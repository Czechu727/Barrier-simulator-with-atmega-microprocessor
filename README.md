# Barrier simulator with atmega microprocessor
The program, along with the circuit in the simulator, is designed to replicate the barrier at the gates on the highway. The display shows commands to the driver, the LEDs reproduce the green and red lights, the servo reproduces the barrier, and the DC motor simulates the car. When the display shows the command to take a ticket, the mode contact is pressed after shorting which the light turns green, the barrier rises and the car starts.

To open the simulator, open the SimullDE folder, then the bin folder and run simulide.exe.
To load the simulation circuit, use the Open Circuit button which is located in the row of options to the left of the big red button indicating that the circuit is running. You should open the circuit under the hdd name with the SIMU extension. 
To load the code with which the circuit will work as we want, expand the panel on the right. Then, from the row of buttons that appear to us in the upper right corner, select the Open button, with which we open the file with the .hex extension. When the code loads, we use the UPload button which is located in the same row of buttons (penultimate). 
To run the circuit, press the big red button at the very top.
